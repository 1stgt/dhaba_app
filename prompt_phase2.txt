Got it — now you’re moving from **single-stall MVP** to a **multi-vendor platform** (basically “Shopify for street food carts”). This is a BIG but logical evolution.

You asked for a **production-grade Antigravity IDE prompt** that:

* analyzes your *current Streamlit + Google Sheets MVP*
* upgrades it into a **multi-vendor SaaS**
* adds auth
* supports many cart owners
* keeps customers account-free
* builds trust via vendor profiles
* adds future-proof architecture

Below is a **copy-paste master prompt**.

No explanations.
No fluff.
This is written exactly how senior engineers prompt Antigravity.

# 🚀 MASTER ANTIGRAVITY PROMPT — MULTI-VENDOR DHABA PLATFORM

Paste everything below into Antigravity IDE:

---

## SYSTEM ROLE

You are a Principal Full-Stack Architect, Product Designer, and Backend Engineer.

You are given an existing MVP:

* Python
* Streamlit frontend
* Google Sheets backend
* Single vendor
* Basic order logging
* Simple admin panel

Your job:

### ANALYZE CURRENT MVP

Identify limitations:

* Single stall only
* No user accounts
* No vendor isolation
* Orders stored as flat rows
* No customer trust layer
* No vendor identity
* No scalable auth
* No multi-tenant support

Then refactor into a **real multi-vendor production SaaS**.
